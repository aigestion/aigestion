    <h3>Object model</h3>
    <p>
      Except as described below, the object module exposed should be similar to that exposed by
      Visual Basic, etc. Due to the nature of ActiveX Scripting, the details for each host are
      different, but Python should work "correctly".
    </p>

    <p>
      The object model exposed via Python for MSIE is not as seamless as VB. The biggest limitation
      is the concept of a "local" namespace. For example, in VB, you can code
      <code>text="Hi there"</code>, but in Python, you must code
      <code>MyForm.ThisButton.Text="Hi There"</code>. See the <a href="foo2.htm">foo2</a> sample for
      futher details.
    </p>

    <h3>Known bugs and problems</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          This release seems to have broken Aaron's mouse-trace sample. No idea why, and I'm
          supposed to be looking into it.
          <li>
            <p>
              Builtin objects such as MARQUEE are giving me grief. Objects accessed via forms are
              generally no problem.

                <p>
                  If you are trying to use Python with the Windows Scripting Host, note that .pys
                  files are not correct registered - you will need to explicitly specify either
                  cscript.exe or wscript.exe on the command line.
