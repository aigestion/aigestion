## CHOOSING WHAT TO BUILD

### Priority Matrix

```
         High Impact
              │
    Keep      │      Quick Wins
    Building  │         ↓
              │    ┌─────────┐
   ──────────┼────┤  DO NOW │────────
   Low Impact│    └─────────┘  High Impact
              │         ↑       │
         Nice to Have   │  Consider
              │      Low Effort
```

### Decision Framework

**Ask These Questions:**

1. **Business Impact**
   - Does this align with strategy?
   - What's the customer value?
   - How many customers benefit?

2. **Technical Impact**
   - Does this unblock other work?
   - Reduces technical debt?
   - Improves reliability?

3. **Effort & Risk**
   - How much time required?
   - What's the complexity?
   - Any dependencies?

4. **Opportunity Cost**
   - What else could we do?
   - Is this the best use of time?
   - Can it wait?

### Example Decision Tree

```
New Feature Requested

├─ Does it block other work?
│  ├─ Yes → CRITICAL (Sprint this week!)
│  └─ No → Continue
│
├─ Is it requested by multiple customers?
│  ├─ Yes → HIGH PRIORITY
│  └─ No → MEDIUM PRIORITY
│
├─ Can it be done in <1 week?
│  ├─ Yes → Add to next sprint
│  └─ No → Plan for quarter/roadmap
│
└─ Does it improve reliability/performance?
   ├─ Yes → Worth prioritizing
   └─ No → Consider for later
```

## VELOCITY & CAPACITY PLANNING

### Calculating Velocity

```
Week 1: 5 tasks completed
Week 2: 6 tasks completed
Week 3: 4 tasks completed
Week 4: 5 tasks completed
─────────────────────────────
Average Velocity: 5 tasks/week
```

### Using Velocity for Planning

**Sprint (14 days = 2 weeks):**

- 5 tasks/week × 2 weeks = **10 tasks capacity**
- Realistically add 1-2 more = **11-12 tasks to plan**

**Quarter (90 days = ~13 weeks):**

- 5 tasks/week × 13 weeks = **65 tasks capacity**
- Realistically: **50 tasks to plan** (leaving buffer)

**Year (365 days = 52 weeks):**

- 5 tasks/week × 52 weeks = **260 tasks capacity**
- Realistically: **200 tasks to plan** (leaving buffer)

### Accounting for Reality

**Factors that reduce capacity:**

- Team meetings: -10%
- Firefighting/bugs: -15%
- Support issues: -10%
- Sick days/vacation: -5%
- **Total realistic capacity: ~60% of theoretical**

---

## COMMON PLANNING MISTAKES

### ❌ Over-Committing

**Problem:** Assign 30 tasks for sprint capacity of 15
**Impact:** Nothing gets done, team gets demoralized
**Solution:** Use historical velocity, leave 20% buffer

### ❌ Poor Dependency Management

**Problem:** Schedule Task B but Task A (dependency) isn't done
**Impact:** Task B can't start, blocks progress
**Solution:** Map dependencies, schedule blockers first

### ❌ No Blocker Resolution

**Problem:** Tasks get blocked but no one unblocks them
**Impact:** Tasks sit for weeks, velocity drops
**Solution:** Daily blocker review, escalate quickly

### ❌ Scope Creep

**Problem:** Keep adding tasks to sprint mid-way
**Impact:** Team overwhelmed, nothing finishes
**Solution:** Freeze sprint scope after Day 2

### ❌ Ignoring Velocity

**Problem:** Plan same tasks every sprint even though velocity is 5/week
**Impact:** Consistently miss commitments
**Solution:** Track velocity, adjust planning accordingly

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Track These Numbers

| Metric                | Target         | What It Means                  |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Completion Rate**   | 90%+           | We finish what we plan         |
| **Velocity Trend**    | Stable/growing | Consistent or improving output |
| **Blocker Time**      | <1 week        | Unblock issues quickly         |
| **Overdue Items**     | <10%           | Most work completes on time    |
| **Team Satisfaction** | 8/10+          | Team feels good about plans    |
