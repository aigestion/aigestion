   * This method applies a set of structured intrinsic metadata to an evaluated
   * result from a parsed CSS-like string of expressions. Intrinsics provide
   * sufficient metadata (e.g., basis values, analogs for keywords) such that
   * omitted values in the input string can be backfilled, and keywords can be
   * converted to concrete numbers.
   *
   * The result of applying intrinsics is a tuple of NumberNode values whose
   * units match the units used by the basis of the intrinsics.
   *
   * The following is a high-level description of how intrinsics are applied:
   *
   *  1. Determine the value of 'auto' for the current term
   *  2. If there is no corresponding input value for this term, substitute the
   *     'auto' value.
   *  3. If the term is an IdentNode, treat it as a keyword and perform the
   *     appropriate substitution.
   *  4. If the term is still null, fallback to the 'auto' value
   *  5. If the term is a percentage, apply it to the basis and return that
   *     value
   *  6. Normalize the unit of the term
   *  7. If the term's unit does not match the basis unit, return the basis
   *     value
   *  8. Return the term as is
